1. It needs to determine which default boxes correspond to a ground truth detection.
2. First, using Jaccard overlap,  they match DB to any GT which is satisfied with ￼
3. This simplifies the learning problem, 
    allowing the network to predict high scores for multiple overlapping default boxes 
    rather than requiring it to pick only the one with maximum overlap.
